In this video I learned how to create basic hello world program

and two methods to install react app

1. npx create-react-app <project-name>        2. npm install create-react-app-g 
 npm package runner will take care of             it will install globally 
 installation                                         create-react-app
  we don't have to do                            we have to consistently update package
